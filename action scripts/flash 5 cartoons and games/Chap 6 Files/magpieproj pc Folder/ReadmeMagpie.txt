**********************************************************************Please note that because of the way Magpie Pro refers to files it may lose track of associated files through the CD making process. The expression sets are particularly sensitive to this. You may have to rebuild the expression set mentioned in the book. Please follow the Magpie Pro help PDF document instructions on creating expression sets. All the files needed are in this folder. If you end up using Magpie Pro regularly this will be good practice as these expression sets you'll create are the foundation of the program's working ability.
