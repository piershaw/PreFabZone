##########  PHP/Text Files Forum ############

For the first time.

1) Create a directory called Forum on your server.

2) Create 4 folders called Category1, Category2, Category3, Category4 in that directory (Forum).
These directorys/folders must be named those exact Names - Category1 and Category2 For example.

So it looks like this
Forum/
Forum/Category1/
Forum/Category2/
Forum/Category3/
Forum/Category4/

3) Change the permissions of each Category folder/directory to 777 - (on windows/Apache you won't have to worry about that) - If your using Win2k/NT with IIS - you will have to make sure the directorys have write permissions.  Actually this may not work on Win2K with IIS web server - But will with Win2K/Apache web server.

4) Place the Forum.php file and Forum.swf in that directory.

5) That's it.  Follow the notes in the Forum.php file and on the Forum.Fla file to learn how to customize everything - hopefully it's somewhat intuitive.
